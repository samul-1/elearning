# A Django + Vue app for elearning

# A quick glance

This app is intended to be used as a tool for putting students' skills in a subject to test, as well as aiding them in preparing for an exam.

Teachers can create boards for their subject or course, add multiple-choice questions, and monitor the grades that students get.

Students can sign up to a course and take tests that are made up of randomly chosen questions among those added by teachers. There is full support for LaTeX in questions and answers texts.

Teachers can choose to have the questions for their course grouped in topics/categories and to have them appear in tests taken by students with a specific distribution (i.e., 2 questions from this category, 3 from the other one, and so on). They can moreover add assistants, that is users with the ability to add/edit questions for that course.

Finally, students will have a history of questions they have seen already, so they can review them, and a history of the tests they've taken, so they can monitor how they're doing over the longer term.

A more thorough documentation is being worked on currently. Please note that the code for this app uses English names and comments, but the app texts are in Italian.
